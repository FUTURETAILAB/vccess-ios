The figure was originally released at the museum and on the museum's web shop on December 9th, followed by an online release on KAWSONE on December 12th. This figure carried a retail price of $480 and sold out quickly across both releases. Each figure comes housed in a custom box and stands at 14 inches tall. Place a bid today to secure this one-of-a-kind piece of art."
